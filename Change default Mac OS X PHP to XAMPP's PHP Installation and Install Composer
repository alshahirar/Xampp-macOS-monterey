##CChange default Mac OS X PHP to XAMPP's PHP Installation and Install Composer
Find out what version of PHP is running

which php
This will output the path to the default PHP install which comes preinstalled by Mac OS X, by default

/usr/bin/php
Now, we just need to swap this over to the PHP that is installed with XAMPP, which is located at /Applications/XAMPP/bin

1.vim ~/.bash_profile

Type i and then paste the following at the top of the file:

 export PATH=/Applications/XAMPP/bin:$PATH
Hit ESC, Type :wq, and hit Enter

In Terminal, run source ~/.bash_profile

In Terminal, type in which php again and look for the updated string. If everything was successful, It should output the new path to XAMPP PHP install.

###Install Composer
Now you can fire the command to install the composer:

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/bin
After the download & installation is done, You can add this alias to your .bash_profile or .profile file to get composer to work globally instead of php /usr/bin/composer.phar command.

alias composer="php /usr/bin/composer.phar"
You can verify your installation worked by typing the following command within the Terminal:

composer
